Instead of following hard-coded instructions, systems use algorithms to find patterns in data, make predictions, and perform tasks like classifying information or suggesting products based on past behavior. \\n\\nHow it works\\n- Training: A model is \"trained\" on a large dataset that is similar to the real-world problem it needs to solve. For example, a model can be trained on thousands of pictures labeled \"cat\" or \"truck\".\\n- Learning patterns: The algorithm learns to recognize the key features or patterns that distinguish between different categories, such as the features that make up a cat versus a truck.\\n- Generalization: Once trained, the model can then apply what it learned to new, unseen data to make accurate predictions or decisions. For instance, it can identify a cat in a photo it has never seen before. \\n\\nKey applications\\n -Personalized recommendations: Suggesting products on an e-commerce site or movies on a streaming platform based on user history.\\n- Fraud detection: Identifying unusual activity in financial transactions that could indicate fraud.\\n- Image and speech recognition: Enabling features like facial recognition on a phone or voice assistants to understand commands.\\n- Healthcare: Analyzing patient data to help with diagnostics or personalizing treatments.\\n- Autonomous vehicles: Using data from cameras and sensors to help a car learn to navigate, steer, and brake safely.
